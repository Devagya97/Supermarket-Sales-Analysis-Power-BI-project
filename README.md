# Supermarket Sales Analysis
**Overview:**
This project involves the analysis and visualization of supermarket sales data using MySQL for data storage and view creation, and Power BI for data modeling and visualization. The objective is to gain insights into sales patterns, identify top-performing products, and understand regional sales trends to inform business decisions.

**Problem Statement:**
In a competitive retail environment, understanding sales patterns and customer preferences is crucial for maximizing revenue and profitability. Our supermarket chain faces challenges in identifying the best-selling product categories, top-performing products, and regional sales trends. Additionally, we need to understand seasonal variations in sales to optimize inventory and marketing strategies. This project aims to address these challenges by analyzing sales data and providing actionable insights.

Removed duplicates and irrelevant data.
Handled missing values by imputing or removing them
Standardized data formats (e.g., dates, categories).

**Data Processing and Modeling:**
Views Creation: Views were created in MySQL to streamline data extraction and transformation.
Data Modeling: Data modeling was performed in Power BI to establish relationships and optimize the structure for analysis and visualization.
